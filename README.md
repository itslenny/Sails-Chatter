# Sails Chatter

A very simple real-time chat app using [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org) and socket.io.

####Features

* Pure JavaScript frontend (no jQuery, Angular, etc)
* Multiple rooms
* Private messages
* Messages stored in postgres db

This was built in 45 minutes so it is a really bare-bones chat app. It is designed as an example of using socket. There are obviously a ton of optimizations that could be done.
